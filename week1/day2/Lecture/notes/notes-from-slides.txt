!!WHAT is React?:
- JS library 
- What is a library?: https://careerfoundry.com/en/blog/web-development/programming-library-guide/ 
- Created by Meta (facebook) around 2010
- Released to public 2013 
- One of the most popular front-end libraries 


!!WHY React?
- React has the ability to do client side rendering and server side rendering
- Single Page Application (SPA) we only have 1 HTML file and we use JS to write components that will load in that HTML file and seamlessly change what the user sees and interacts with 
- Virtual DOM is a lightweight version of the standard DOM that syncs up and allows the regular DOM to change specific pieces as the virtual DOM does
This is more efficient than changing the whole DOM as changing the whole DOM means we have to reload everything even if we are only changing one or a couple things on the web page
